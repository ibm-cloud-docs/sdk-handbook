# Support

## Support channels

The SDK SHOULD clearly document the proper channels for reporting errors or requesting assistance in using the SDK.
These channels SHOULD include GitHub issues, posts to StackOverflow, and other popular developer sites.
These channels SHOULD be continuously monitored by the SDK team and responses SHOULD be provided in a timely manner.

## Support expiration

The SDK SHOULD clearly document the earliest date for expiration of support at the time the SDK released.
For "official" SDK releases (major version 1 or later), the expiration of support SHOULD be at least one year
from the release date of the SDK.

## Community contributions

The SDK SHOULD encourage community contributions both in words and in actions
(by accepting pull requests from community developers).
The process for community contributions SHOULD be clearly described in the `CONTRIBUTING` doc of the repo.

## Contributors License Agreement

All contributors to the SDK MUST be required to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA)
before contributions are accepted.

The SDK SHOULD use the [cla-assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) integration in its GitHub repo.
This is a standard and auditable way to ensure that the CLA is signed by all contributors.
